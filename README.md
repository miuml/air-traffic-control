air-traffic-control
===================

This is a teaching and testing example of a complete Executable UML model within a single domain.

It is for a contrived Air Traffic Control problem which has nothing to do with how air traffic is actually controlled!

It consists (at this point) of a class model, two state models, and some domain functions and class methods.

For now the action language is psuedo-coded.  It is at the correct abstraction level for an executable UML action language, but it does not conform to any standard and is only barely parsable.  But hey, it's a start!

This is the same model described in Leon's Articulate UML article found on the uml.org home page.
